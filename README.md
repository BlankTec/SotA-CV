# SotA-CV
A repository of state-of-the-art deep learning results in computer vision.
It aims to collect and maintain up-to-date information on the latest developments in
in computer vision, facilitating the research effort in deep learning.

Unlike other attempts in collaborative tracking of research progress,
this repository provides aggregate results of quantitative evaluation. 
Such practice allows to greatly simplify both the initial literature search and preparing a comparative study of your own results.
